# Javascript And Classes

<!-- Yes 👍, JavaScript does have classes, but there’s an important detail:

Before ES6 (2015): JavaScript didn’t have classes in the traditional sense (like Java, C++, etc.). Instead, it used prototypes for inheritance and object creation.

After ES6: The class keyword was introduced, which provides syntactic sugar over JavaScript’s prototype-based inheritance.

That means classes in JavaScript are not truly new structures — they are just a cleaner, more familiar way to work with prototypes. -->
